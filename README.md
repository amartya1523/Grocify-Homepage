# Grocify-Homepage
<h1>Description</h1>
Welcome to the Grocify Homepage project! ðŸŽ‰

I have made this with Tailwind CSS to take advantage of its utility-first approach, which makes the development process faster and the codebase cleaner.
<h3>What's New?</h3>
Tailwind CSS Integration: The entire project has been revamped using Tailwind CSS, offering a more streamlined and efficient styling process.
Enhanced Design: Improved the visual design and responsiveness of the homepage with Tailwind's extensive utility classes.
Maintainability: Easier to maintain and extend styles due to Tailwind's intuitive and component-friendly architecture.
